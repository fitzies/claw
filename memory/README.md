# Memory System

This directory stores memories you ask Claw to remember.

## How it works

When you say "remember this" or similar, Claw creates a new `.md` file in this directory with:
- Date/time
- The content you wanted saved
- Any context

## Files

Each file follows the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD--topic-or-title.md`

Example: `2026-02-14--favorite-color.md`
