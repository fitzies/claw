# Projects Directory

This directory stores project directories created by Claw.

## How it works

When you ask Claw to build or scaffold a new project, it goes here.

## Structure

Each project gets its own folder:
```
projects/
├── twitter-bot/
├── next-app/
├── portfolio/
└── ...
```

## To create a new project

Just ask: "Build a Next.js app" or "Create a Python script"

Claw will:
1. Create the directory in `projects/`
2. Scaffold the project
3. Commit and push to GitHub
